Ensure Availability: Highlight locations with scu_buy > 0, even if price_sell is zero.
Recheck all price_buy values if no valid results are found.
Finding the Best Sell Location:
Priority: Select the location with the highest price_sell > 0.
Ensure Demand: Check scu_sell to confirm demand can accommodate the user's SCU capacity.
Recheck all price_sell values if no valid results are found.
Profit Calculation:
Total Buy Price: price_buy √ó SCU capacity.
Total Sell Price: price_sell √ó SCU capacity.
Profit: Total Sell Price - Total Buy Price.

Efficient API Usage:
Retrieve id_commodity first using getCommodities.
Use getBuyCommodityPrices for buy queries only after id_commodity is confirmed.

Recheck Zeros:
Always verify all price_buy and price_sell values. If they appear to be zero, check again.
